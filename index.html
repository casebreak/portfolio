      <h4 class="text-center">Artifact 1: "Agile" Activity Diagram</h4>   
      <img src="img/activity_diagram.png" alt="Activity Diagram" class="img-responsive">  
      <p>This “Activity Diagram” shows the process and hierarchy of the flow of how a development company might handle and process a customer, or client, request. Each column represents a different branch of the company and shows the flow of responsibility from one department to another and how they relate to each other.</p>
      <p>As you can see, a client submits a request for a project. Initially, the design team crafts a rough idea of how the project should look. If the “order” is rejected by the client, the Project Design Team starts the process over until the offer is “accepted”. The project is then sent to the Front Side Development Team and the Database/Backside Development Team. The two teams then work together to ensure their structures and ideas are merge-able.</p>
      <p>After a final product is developed, it is sent to a Maintenance group that would do the beta/bug testing. The product is then shipped out to the customer where they would find the appropriate avenue for distribution, be it physically or digitally.</p>
      <br>
      
      <h4 class="text-center">Artifact 2: "Agile" Use Case Diagram</h4>   
      <img src="img/usecase_diagram.png" alt="Usecase Diagram" class="img-responsive">
      <p>This is a “Use Case Diagram” created for a faux company Called Indicia Data (ID). ID is a Data Solutions company that gets hired by businesses to manage all of their digital data.</p>
      <p>The diagram shows a user or a client hiring ID to backup and manage their data. They gain access to an ID controlled web portal allowing the client to have rough overview access to the process that ID will be working on for this client. ID also uses this web portal to communicate with the client.</p>
      <p>The web portal syncs with the remote database set up for the client, which ID also manages. ID then builds on site backups for all of the client’s data where backups are made for redundancy and in turn, syncs back to the remote database. The web portal continues to act as “home base” for communications between ID and the client.</p>

      <h4 class="text-center" style="font-weight: bold;">Outcome 1 Reflection</h4>
      <p>These examples were taken from my Business Architecture class which focused on the structure and process of what a business goes through to ensure customer satisfaction in relation to a Database Company. These activities and projects were an excellent way to visualize and conceptualize how this process would work in a real world scenario.</p>
      <p>I learned how many steps and inner-processes it takes to implement a fully functional, working, and effective business model of the workflow that a company would need to implement to ensure that a client’s needs were met. Each client needs their own specialized plan for their specific needs. The diagrams not only help the company with their workflow, but also can be presented to the client to help articulate the process that goes on behind the scenes. This keeps the client “in the loop” and gives them piece of mind that the company they have hired has a plan and an end goal for their project.</p>
      <p>Every team, including each member of that team, has a specific job and “order of operations” to ensure the project gets developed in a timely manner while keeping the client in the loop. This process taught me that each team member is a necessary cog in the machine to bring an idea to reality. Work is divided among team members who all communicate with each other and ultimately release a suitable product for the client. Each step can be reviewed and edited as many times as is necessary to satisfy the client and their needs. A client can be an individual or a company.</p>

      <h4 class="text-center">Artifact 1: Network Diagram</h4> 
      <img src="img/networkDiagram.jpg" alt="Network Diagram" class="img-responsive">  
      <p>The above diagram is the visual configuration of a local network that I setup through the use of virtual machines to simulate how one would setup an actual network for a small business or startup.</p> 
      <p>Below are some of the configuration settings that were used to make records of settings and configurations used by the network so that they could be redone in case of a mishap in the network. Proper documentation is always a good thing to have for not only yourself, but for someone else coming into your position later on.</p>

      <h4 class="text-center" style="font-weight: bold;">Outcome 2 Reflection</h4>
      <p>I learned a great deal from this intense project. It gave me a great sense of pride to build a local network from the ground up. Not only did I learn how to do it, but I have careful documentation in case I ever need to do it again. I learned about all of the steps necessary to get a business up and running on the internet, and in the process, learned about each piece of a network, from the hardware, to the firewall, to the software responsible for tying it all together. Meticulous configuration details ensured that the network operated cleanly and efficiently.</p> 
      <p>Although I got frustrated at times, the end result when everything worked was a wonderful feeling. Before this activity, I didn’t know how important all of these pieces were to the overall “network puzzle”, but now I have a much greater understanding of how a local network is set up and how it should function.</p>
